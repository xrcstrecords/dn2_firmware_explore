// reader_m9.asm -- Waverider Milestone 9a: reader_m5.asm with a gain. Each sample is
// multiplied by the float at DM 0x2de6c0, which machine9_live.asm writes before every
// call: LEV / 100 (LEV1 for osc 1), so the default level 100 is exactly 1.0 and the
// output is bit-identical to reader_m5.asm's there.
//
// What follows is reader_m5.asm's own description, unchanged:
//
// reader_m5.asm -- Waverider Milestone 5: reader.asm (Milestone 1) restricted to the
// instruction forms the shipping firmware itself uses, for the first flash.
//
// Our own code, assembled with selache's `selas` (GPL-3.0, used as a tool and never
// linked in). Run offline in digikit's SHARC executor and checked bit for bit against
// dnfw.waverider.render (float32); it has never run on a DSP.
//
// Same contract as reader.asm -- wr_render(R4 = params), 16 frames x 512 int16, linear
// between samples and between frames; the block is (table, phase, inc, pos, count,
// out) -- and the same arithmetic, in the same order, so it is bit-identical. What
// changed, and why (docs/waverider-m5-dsp.md, "Instruction forms"):
//
// 1. **No DAG1 M0-M3 in a memory access.** Of the firmware's 1,266 16-bit Type 3c
//    accesses, every one names M4-M7; M0-M3 appear in no Type 3a/3c access at all.
//    For M0-M3 selas and selache's own disassembler disagree -- selas's
//    `R3 = DM(I0, M0)` (0x9013) reads to selmap as a load into DADDR, and
//    `R4 = DM(M2, I0)` as `DM(M6, I0)` -- so which one the silicon follows is not
//    known, and reader.asm's frame-row dummy reads and inner-loop taps used them.
//    Here the rows are byte arithmetic on the table pointer (a frame is 1,024 bytes),
//    the firmware's own idiom (`r1 = r4 + r1` at 0x1c9259), and the taps use M4.
// 2. **No pre-modify read and no hardware DO loop (Milestone 5c).** M5's inner loop
//    was `LCNTR = R2, DO ... UNTIL LCE` with pre-modify `DM(M4, I0)` taps. selas
//    encodes that DO with the loop-`mode` bit (bit 23) clear. The firmware sets it
//    on every short straight-line loop (e.g. sw 0x1c9492, `0c0d80000c00`) and
//    clears it on loops with branches in the body. digikit's executor ignores the
//    bit, so the runner cannot tell whether the silicon does. M5 silenced the
//    instrument, and the hardware discriminators placed the fault on this reader
//    path (docs/waverider-dsp-silence.md). 5c counts in software: the count word
//    of the parameter block, decremented and stored each sample, and
//    `IF NE JUMP` back, the form the always-running loop proved on silicon.
//    Each tap is byte arithmetic, then `I0 = Rn`, then `DM(0, I0)` (Type 15b),
//    which also removes the pre-modify form selas mis-compresses outside a loop.
//    The float arithmetic, in the same order, is unchanged, so the result is
//    bit-identical to M5's.
// 3. **An add whose first operand is R8-R15** where the 16-bit form would be a
//    parcel 0xc000..0xc07f, which digikit's decoder can read as the first half of a
//    32-bit Type 2b (runner gap G5); selas then emits a 32-bit form both decoders
//    read alike.
//
// The gate (scripts/sharc_waverider_m5.py) checks that selmap and digikit read every
// instruction here as its source line says.
//
// Parameter block (8 words): table, phase, inc, pos, count, out, f0 row, f1 row. The
// reader counts `count` down to 0 (machine5_live.asm rewrites it every block) and
// keeps the two frame-row addresses in words 6 and 7.
//
// Clobbers R0-R15, I0, I2, I4, ASTAT. Uses M6 = 1, M7 = -1, M14 = 1 as fixed by the
// SHARC C ABI. Not ABI-clean: machine5_live.asm saves what it needs. I3 and I5 are
// the loop's own pointers and are not touched.
//
// PLACEMENT IS FIXED at PM sw 0x16eb00 (L1 block 1, byte 0x2dd600): the two
// absolute jumps below are written for it from selas's symbol table.
