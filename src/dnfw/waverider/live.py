"""What Milestone 5's type-5 loop computes from a track's own state: the contract
`csrc/waverider/sharc/machine5_live.asm` is held to, bit for bit.

The loop reads three things the frame unpack `sw 0x1c2712` has already put in DSP
memory, measured by running that unpack (`scripts/sharc_waverider_m5.py`):

| what | where | form |
|---|---|---|
| SLOT, WaveTone's `TBL1` (param 27) | the frame copy `0x25c48c`, offset `222 + 146t` | 16-bit, the sound's value: 0x0000 or 0x0100 |
| POS, WaveTone's `WAV1` (param 26) | the frame copy, offset `220 + 146t` | 16-bit, the sound's value: 0..0x7800 |
| pitch | engine `+0x1387c + 4t` (`0x254b14 + 4t`) | float semitones, note + fine/256 |
| TUNE, WaveTone's `TUN1` (param 25, Milestone 6) | the frame copy, offset `218 + 146t` | 16-bit, the sound's value: word / 256 - 64 semitones |

The unpack writes a type-5 track's machine parameters nowhere else: its record's
machine window is left as it is (measured, the same for any parameter value), so
the loop reads the copy of the frame the unpack itself made.

and turns them into `reader_m5.asm`'s parameter block:

- **table**: the directory's entry for `TBL1 >> 8`; at or above the count plays 0;
- **pos**: `min(WAV1, 0x7800) << 5`, Q16 frames (0x7800 << 5 is frame 15);
- **inc**: from the note plus TUN1, through a 129-entry float32 table `T` of phase steps
  (`increment_table`): `k = trunc(n)`, `fr = n - k`, `inc = trunc(T[k] + fr *
  (T[k+1] - T[k]))`, every operation rounded to float32 in the loop's order;
- **phase**: carried in the block from one block to the next, from 0.

**The frame carries the sound's own values** (read on the instrument through the
USB probe, 2026-09-30, `tools/dn2probe_frame.py`): TUN1 `0x4000` at 0, `0x4100` at
+1, `0x4c00` at +12, `0x3400` at -12; WAV1 `0x7800` at the top; TBL1 `0x0100` at 1.
Until then this module, the loop and the gates read **half** the sound's value, as
frames from the ColdFire emulator had shown (FREQ 0x6117 -> 0x308c, WAV1 0x7800 ->
0x3c00, TBL1 0x0100 -> 0x0080). Those frames were taken while the values were still
gliding to their targets after the snapshot loaded (the same run shows slot 0 and
the level headers gliding with nothing touched), so "half" was a moment, not a
scale. On the instrument that put POS's last frame halfway up WAV1, kept TBL1 1 on
table 0, and read TUN1 0 as +64 semitones.

This module is pure: numbers in, numbers out.
